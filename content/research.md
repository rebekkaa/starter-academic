      title: Research
      text: "I am interested in human-on-the-loop autonomous systems. These software-intensive systems make a lot of decisions autonomously.
To enable successful human-machine collaboration, humans need to **understand the decisions that are made** by these systems.
Humans also need to be able to **express their own needs** in a way that machines understand.

My research focuses on the following questions:

* How can we (continuously) elicit preferences and goals that people deem important in autonomous systems? [[REFSQ 2021](/publication/wohlrab-2021-refsq/)[, REJ 2022](/publication/wohlrab-2021-rej/)[, SEAMS 2022](/publication/wohlrab-2022-seams/)]

* How can quality tradeoffs be explained to humans, so that it is easier to understand how systems behave? [[JSS 2023 (Wohlrab et al.)](/publication/wohlrab-2023-jss/)[, ECSA 2023 (Diaz-Pace et al.)](/publication/diazpace-2023-ecsa/)]

* How can systems be monitored to ensure that safety and security constraints are fulfilled, but so that we can reduce energy consumption and required bandwidth? [[CNS'22](/publication/vierhauser-2022-cns/)[, JSS 2023 (Vierhauser et al.)](/publication/vierhauser-2023-jss/)]
