I am interested in human-on-the-loop autonomous systems. These systems adapt their behavior or structure in response to changes in their environment. They commonly interact with humans.
Self-adaptive systems make a lot of decisions autonomously. It is still desirable to involve humans and help them make decisions that are difficult to automate. Those decisions are often connected to tradeoffs, e.g., when deciding how much to prioritize different competing quality attributes (such as security, performance, and cost). It is often difficult for humans to understand the consequences of decisions and to specify decision criteria. When is it worth it to ramp up security features, although that might compromise performance? Those trade-offs depend on the current context of the system and what is desirable might change over time.

To address these issues, I create techniques to explain self-adaptive systems and to capture people’s (potentially changing) preferences. I also do empirical research to study these problems in large-scale industrial settings.

My research focuses on the following questions:
* How can we elicit preferences and goals that people deem important in self-adaptive systems? [[REFSQ 2021](/publication/wohlrab-2021-refsq/)[, REJ 2022](/publication/wohlrab-2021-rej/)]
* How can we improve the quality of self-adaptive systems and ensure that systems meet humans’ needs over time? [[SEAMS 2022]](/publication/wohlrab-2022-seams/)
* How can quality tradeoffs be explained to humans, so that it is easier to understand how self-adaptive systems behave? [[JSS 2023 (Wohlrab et al.)]](/publication/wohlrab-2023-jss/)
* How can systems be monitored to ensure that safety and security constraints are fulfilled, but so that we can reduce energy consumption and required bandwidth? [[CNS'22](/publication/vierhauser-2022-cns/)[, JSS 2023 (Vierhauser et al.)](/publication/vierhauser-2023-jss/)]
* How can human engineers in large organizations share knowledge effectively over time?
