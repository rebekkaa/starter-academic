I am a postdoctoral researcher in Software Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am part of the [ABLE Research Group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/index.html).
Prior to that, I was affiliated with [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/se/Pages/default.aspx) in Gothenburg, Sweden, where I also received my PhD.

My research interests include requirements engineering, software architecture, and self-adaptive systems.
I perform empirical studies in these areas and investigate, develop, and assess tools and techniques to engineer understandable and high-quality software systems.
