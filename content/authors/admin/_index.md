I am an Assistant Professor in Software Engineering at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/) in Gothenburg, Sweden. During 2020-2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu/).

I hold a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/se/Pages/default.aspx) and a BSc and MSc in Computer Science from [Paderborn University](https://www.uni-paderborn.de/), Germany.

I do research in the areas of self-adaptive systems, software architecture, and requirements engineering. You can find a description of my research interests [below](/#research).
