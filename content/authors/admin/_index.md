I am a postdoctoral researcher in Software Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I am part of the [ABLE Research Group](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~able/index.html).
Before starting at CMU, I was affiliated with Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, where I also received my PhD.
My research is supported by a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) Postdoctoral Scholarship by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

I am interested in software architecture, continuous software engineering, requirements engineering, and self-adaptive systems.
I have developed the concept of [Living Boundary Objects](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/515968), which focuses on documents or models that support coordination between multidisciplinary teams and create a common understanding in large-scale systems development.
Many of my studies have been performed in collaboration with automotive companies.
