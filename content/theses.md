You can find a list of possible thesis topics for MSc and BSc students below.

* Designing a system to adapt quality attributes for autonomous systems.
	* Description: Autonomous systems (e.g., robots or vehicles) need to plan their actions under the consideration of multiple quality attributes. For instance, energy consumption, cost, performance, and safety need to be balanced and traded off against each other. We developed a preliminary system to collect feedback from users regarding what quality attributes are important for a system. The goal of this thesis is to design a system that helps human users express their (potentially changing) quality preferences and track how a running system meets their quality needs.
* Supporting continuous compliance in automotive companies. With Systemite AB, a design science study.
* Developing a tool to explain architectural design alternatives and guide human decision-making for architects of automotive systems. In collaboration with Volvo Cars.
* Investigating architectural change/stability based on tool data from automotive companies. In collaboration with Systemite AB.
* Explaining tradeoffs in multi-objective security games.
	* Description: Adversarial environments are often modeled using game theory (e.g., as Markov games). In these games, defenders can use a variety of actions in cybersecurity-critical environments and typically need to trade off performance and cybersecurity. The aim of this thesis is to develop a data-driven approach that analyzes data from security games, elicits tradeoffs, and explains them to humans so that they can make better decisions.
